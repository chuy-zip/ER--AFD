## About the code

This folder has the code made last semester by Ricardo Chuy on the course "Teoría de la Computación" for project 1, "Creation and simulation of NFA and DFA". Here we make an AST from a regex, from AST we transform into NFA, NFA to DFA and DFA to minimized DFA.

The repository is the following:
